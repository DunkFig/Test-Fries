I’ll be far away, my sights trained from the tedium of measured breath and drones, eyes plump, fixated on some stale dry light. All I am is a receptacle for media - a lie (although perhaps maybe the inverse of the biggest lie). Still - I submit to its steady bludgeoning flow. The Carrot and the Stick baby, that’s really all I am. Does that disappoint you? Or does my admission of simplicity turn you on? There's something substantial in letting yourself be driven entirely by your reactions, there’s something honest in finding god on television.","It starts again: Big-blue-sky commercials where we turn into metal and fly through the suburbs. Giant shoes we sit in like sarcophagi sprout wings, delivering us to the clouds. I am giant, powerful and kind, I help the townsfolk move their city. I own a large warehouse of mattresses, a claymation crocodile in sunglasses exclaims that my prices are quite low. I am a talking dog with a mexican accent, despite my small stature I represent a large chain of fast food restaurants. I am the President of the United States - I regret the tragic decisions we’ve had to make, but it’s always been part of my agenda to have a hard line on drugs. Repeated frequently enough to be rehearsed mentally. Everyone on the screen possesses such agency. Why - at 5 - at my most free, am I perpetually being sold ‘freedom’.","At 4. I wake up inside my own frozen body. Down the hallway bounce colorful reflections from the TV - out of direct sight, but heard clearly. The connection between my body and mind is lost, no little voice escapes me. The specter of every vestige flails riotously, unable to persuade the flesh - the result is a psychic pain. I am forced to watch the residual light - from commercials, sitcoms, laugh tracks, and jingles. The light feels sentient, like a burbling swarm that occupies real space in my home. I can’t move my mouth, or muster air from my lungs to scream. My psyche is pourous, I am unable to swat it all away as it comes flooding in. It sits there watching me without malice or spite.","Hell is Crimson with highlights of tangerine and lows of deep maroon. God is a white man with long hair and a girlish face. Satan is a faceless liar with horns. Each night they perform for the sake of my immortal soul. They take up space in my mind's eye, wrestling with each other until I get tired. Tension, but a comic tension, each of them too archetypal to be real. This new third thing is too filled out to be Lucifer or Jesus Christ - it could encompass each of them simultaneously. They’d be spread thin across its expanse, like a fly on the windshield of a 16 wheeler. Eviscerated, pulled in a kajillion different directions simultaneously, pulled outward through dimensions we can’t even see or feel. The crucifixion was light work, the exile from heaven was nothing more than a holiday.","The light - Atoms from a cathode ray, shot at high speeds to create the illusion of an image, the same image all across the world - at the same time, same thing. Its ghost tangled up in dark hallways, swung over ceiling fans, casting long shadows with a shimmering blanket. The numb mumur of constricted limbs - incarnate and curious. Its breath displaces waves of itself, like silk sheets on the ocean floor.  Passive, calm and unaware of the superficial minutiae that takes place on the surface; it doesn’t care about shoes, cigarettes, or junk food - It just wants to spread out, extending a gracious hand to each possibility it might arrive at. Is it Impossible to believe that something as simple as entropy could be kind? ","All of it. Just barely out of reach. 15 second intervals each marching in different directions, unaware that they pull-taught the fabric of something much grander, apathetic to any corporate agenda or goal. Economies collapse in the glacial time it takes for this beast to change its course, it's awake. It sees me frozen.
